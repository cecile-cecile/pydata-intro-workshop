# Intro to Data Analysis in Python
## PyLadies Vancouver Workshop

Coming soon in June 2018! Right now, this repo is just a collection of my notes and brain dumps. Soon this mess will magically morph into slides and exercises for a half-day interactive workshop.

### Tentative Agenda

#### 1. Getting oriented

- Navigating the Python world as a data geek
- Human-centered, interactive tools: IPython and Jupyter
- Quick recap of Python basics

#### 2. The power of Pandas

- Loading and summarizing spreadsheet data
- Creating graphs
- Diving deeper into data analysis

#### 3. Onwards and upwards

- Visual storytelling with data: a brief tour of the Python landscape
- Next steps, ideas, and inspiration
