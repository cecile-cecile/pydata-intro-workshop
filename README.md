**Coming soon in June 2018!** Right now, the Github repo above is mostly just a collection of my notes and brain dumps. Soon this mess will magically morph into slides and exercises for a half-day interactive workshop.

# Intro to Data Analysis in Python
## PyLadies Vancouver Workshop

### Skill Level: Beginner
A little bit of previous experience with Python or another coding language would be helpful, but not required!

### Description
In this workshop, you will develop skills with powerful data analysis tools from Python's rich ecosystem of libraries. If you're wrestling with spreadsheets on a regular basis and want to find better ways to analyze and visualize your data, handle messy and missing data, and automate repetitive tasks, this workshop is for you. If you're a software developer or other Python enthusiast who is curious about Python's data analysis capabilities, this workshop is also for you!

Working with real-world data and the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library, you'll learn how to load data from a comma-separated values (csv) file, quickly summarize it from many different angles, and visualize it in graphs&mdash;all with just a few lines of code. You'll also learn how to dive into the data for a deeper analysis with techniques such as subsets, filters, text processing, and aggregation.

### Setup
When the slides, data files, and other workshop materials are ready, I'll provide a link here to download them as a zipped folder.

You'll want to bring your laptop for lots of hands-on practice as we work through the lessons and exercises. We'll be using Python 3.6, Jupyter notebook, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and other libraries. I recommend using Anaconda to set everything up, especially if you're new to Python and/or data analysis is your main reason for using Python. Please check back here later for installation instructions and data download links&mdash;coming soon...

### Pre-Workshop Survey
A bit of info about you can help me customize the workshop to best address students' needs and goals. If you'd like to help out by completing a short, anonymous survey, please <a href="https://jenfly.typeform.com/to/sNEFUa" target="_blank">click here</a>.
